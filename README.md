# Fruit Classifier with TensorFlow

This project utilizes TensorFlow to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying fruit images. The model is trained with data augmentation techniques to enhance its performance on diverse datasets. The repository includes scripts for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and random image predictions.


## Features

- Data preprocessing and augmentation for improved model generalization
- Training, evaluation, and testing functionalities
- Visualization of training history and random image predictions

## Model Architecture

The CNN model comprises multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by dense layers. This architecture is optimized for accurate image classification tasks.
