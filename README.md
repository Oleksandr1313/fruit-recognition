Fruit Classifier with TensorFlow
This project utilizes TensorFlow to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying fruit images. The model is trained with data augmentation techniques to enhance its performance on diverse datasets. The repository includes scripts for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and random image predictions.

Features
Fruit classification using CNN with TensorFlow.
Data augmentation for improved model generalization.
Preprocessing script for renaming files and folders.
Training, evaluation, and testing functionalities.
Visualization of training history and random image predictions.
Usage
Run the preprocessing script to rename files and folders:

bash
Copy code
python rename_script.py
Execute the main script to train the model:

bash
Copy code
python main_model.py
View the training history, evaluate the model, and perform random image predictions.
